	<p><i> Hi there! We are David Rose & Patrick Brewer, owners and founders of Rose Apothecary.
	<br>
	<br>
	Rose Apothecary is a general store, but it's also a very specific store. It's also not just a store, it's like a place where people can get coffee or drinks, but it's not a coffee shop, nor is it a bar. Yeah, it's an environment. And yes, we will be selling things, but it's more like a branded immersive experience. We source and provide local rebranded produce and crafts. 
    <br>
    <br>
    We have experience with high end artisanal produce and products from a previous life. A life before Schitt's Creek. So we're really happy to be able to introduce you to a finer way of living. 
    <br>
    <br>
    All of our products are gender-neutral, GMO-free, gluten-free, and sustainably sourced. Find more style inspiration on our <a href="file:///Users/lauren.mckeon/Desktop/UX%20Design%20Course/Code%20Project%20Lauren%20V3/blog.html">blog</a>. </i></p>
