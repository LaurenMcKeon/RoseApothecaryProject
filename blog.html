      <h2>Apothecary Apparel: Sustainable Fashion in Schitt's Creek </h2>
      <div class= "body-text-left"> <p>Sustainable fashion is as much about the process as it is about the result – in fact you could argue that fully sustainable fashion doesn’t exist yet. There are many ways in which the fashion industry impacts the environment and communities, from the sourcing of the fabrics to manufacturing, transport, right down to selling and recycling.
‘I don’t like to use the word sustainable, because I find people are scared of it and don’t understand it. But sustainable is the new designer, and local is the new vintage. 

‘There is no fully sustainable brand at this point in time. There are certainly brands that are embedding sustainability in the way they design and think. But making a commitment to shopping local takes a lot of the middle men, extended supply chains and ultimately, all the environmental costs that come with that! Shop our local range here.</p> </div>

      <h2>Hygge Homeware: Autumnal vibes </h2>
      <div class= "body-text-left"> <p>Patrick and I have always been drawn to charming, imperfect little homes. Their details are my favorite to linger on, reminding me that there is something to be said in the less is more category when it comes to square footage. 

You must be selective about what enters your home. You must make the most of your space. And what tends to come out of them is much more personality than you get in square footage that just feels like it has to be filled. 

Candles set an ambience in any home, but our soy candles locally produced by Twyla Smyth are a sensory overload with their fresh and unique fragrance. Shop them here.</p> </div>
